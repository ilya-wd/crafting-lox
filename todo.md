1. Multiline / nested comments
2. Error in comments scanning ?
3. Ternary operator
4. do-while
5. comma operator ? check precedence, associativity
6. error productions for binary operators without left-hand operand. == binary operator at the beginning of an
   expression
7. From "7. Evaluating expressions":
    1. Allowing comparisons on types other than numbers could be useful. The operators might have a reasonable
       interpretation
       for strings. Even comparisons among mixed types, like 3 < "pancake" could be handy to enable things like ordered
       collections of heterogeneous types. Or it could simply lead to bugs and confusion.  
       Would you extend Lox to support comparing other types? If so, which pairs of types do you allow and how do you
       define their ordering? Justify your choices and compare them to other languages.
    2. Many languages define + such that if either operand is a string, the other is converted to a string and the
       results are then concatenated. For example, "scone" + 4 would yield scone4. Extend the code in visitBinaryExpr()
       to support that.
    3. What happens right now if you divide a number by zero? What do you think should happen? Justify your choice. How
       do other languages you know handle division by zero, and why do they make the choices they do?
       Change the implementation in visitBinaryExpr() to detect and report a runtime error for this case.
8. From "8. Staetments and State"
    1. The REPL no longer supports entering a single expression and automatically printing its result value. Thatâ€™s a
       drag. Add support to the REPL to let users type in both statements and expressions. If they enter a statement,
       execute it. If they enter an expression, evaluate it and display the result value.
    2. Maybe you want Lox to be a little more explicit about variable initialization. Instead of implicitly initializing
       variables to nil, make it a runtime error to access a variable that has not been initialized or assigned to
      ```// No initializers.
      var a;
      var b;

      a = "assigned";
      print a; // OK, was assigned first.

      print b; // Error
     ```
